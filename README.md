# learningtocodemon
A joint project in the name of learning some python! 
Members: Alex and David

# Goal and scope
- Learn python by creating a pokedex like program that increases in complexity. 

Dzims:
Vague, general, maybe unobtainable plan-

List of features (in order of increasing complexity):
Data for each Pokemon:
Name
Type
Height/weight
Image
Evolution line
Moves
Breeding
Location per game

Pokemon lookup:
By dex #
By name
By type
By Regional dex
By Game (Game will show only information for that version of the game, example: Charmander from gamelookup:Red will not learn Metal Claw, but Charmander from gamelookup:Fire Red will)

Image based Pokemon recognition:
(Jesus Christ this will be hard for all 721+ Pokemon, but we'll start slow) 
For games from Red to White2, pokedex will identify Pokemon based on their sprite image and give the game the image is from (if possible)

Add GUI (just to style on 'em, ya know?)
